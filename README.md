##Mechanic
-Add a brief description of your mechanic demo
-Add the control scheme
-Add key areas people should focus on
##References
Add references to any asset packs, codes used that you did not develop, including Generative AI (GPT/Copilot). Remember that these cannot be graded towards your work. Failure to reference, however, is academic misconduct.

##Side Notes:
